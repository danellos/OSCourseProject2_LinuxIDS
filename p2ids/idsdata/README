===============

* Examples of "good" system calls are in the "good" folder
* Examples of "bad" system calls are in the "bad" folder

To train the IDS and test it against these files, you should place the "good" ones under userland/logger/logs.
To test the IDS after training it with bad logs, place the "bad" files in userland/logger/logs.
